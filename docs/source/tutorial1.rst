Tutorial 1: Including the pynoise library
=========================================

Getting the pynoise package is very simple.

1. If you don't already have one, create a virtualenv
   ::
      virtualenv --python=python3.4 --no-site-packages venv

2. Enter your virtualenv
   ::
     source venv/bin/activate

3. Install pynoise
   ::
     pip install pynoise

And that's it! Now you can use pynoise, and you're ready for ``tutorial2``
